# Implementation Plan

- Do not write any code unless the implementation plan has been confirmed
  - Keep the implementation plan in a file called `implementation-plan.md` in the project root
  - Do not include any time estimates, just keep it sequential
  - Do not include any project sales-pitch language

# Code Style

- Use meaningful, pronounceable, variable names.
  - Do not abbreviate variable names unless following a well known convention.

- Use consistent indentation
  - Indent with 4 spaces in source code files (.py, .js, etc.)
  - Indent with 2 spaces in Markdown files (.md)

- Ignore my fingers if they type `ls`, it's a tic
