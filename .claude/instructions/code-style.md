- Don't write forgiving code
  - Don't permit multiple input formats
    - In TypeScript, this means avoiding Union Type (the `|` in types)
  - Use preconditions
    - Use schema libraries
    - Assert that inputs match expected formats
    - When expectations are violated, throw, don't log
  - Don't add defensive try/catch blocks
    - Usually we let exceptions propagate out
- Don't use abbreviations or acronyms
  - Choose `number` instead of `num` and `greaterThan` instead of `gt`
  - Use meaningful, pronounceable, variable names.
- Use consistent indentation
  - Indent with 4 spaces in source code files (.py, .js, etc.)
  - Indent with 2 spaces in Markdown files (.md)
